# Additional dependencies for Playwright support
# Use a more recent version of Playwright so that its dependencies (like greenlet)
# support Python 3.13. Version 1.55.0 (released Aug 28 2025) explicitly supports
# Python 3.13 according to the PyPI classifiers【604975336260715†L70-L75】, so pin to
# that version. If a newer version is available it may also work.
