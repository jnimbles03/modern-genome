# The PyPDF2 library relies on the PyCryptodome package for decrypting
# AESâ€‘encrypted PDFs. Without this dependency, trying to read certain
# documents (especially those protected with AES encryption) will raise
# a `DependencyError` stating that PyCryptodome is required.  Adding
# PyCryptodome ensures that encrypted documents can be processed without
# crashing the application.
